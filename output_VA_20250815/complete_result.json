Notably, we improved the long compound recognition accuracy from 0% to 92% through targeted preprocessing adjustments. Additionally, we resolved file management issues related to temporary files, contributing to better system performance and resource management.\n\nTASK 1: Enhancement of Alignment Function\n-------------------\nProblem Description: \nThe alignment function's accuracy was critical for ensuring that input images are matched correctly with templates. Improving this function is essential for the overall effectiveness of our image recognition processes.\n\nSolution Process: \nWe modified the template image processing by transitioning from binary data transmission to utilizing source paths for warp_affine operations. This allowed us to conduct feature matching tests, including scenarios with rotated and skewed template images.\n\nResults: \nThe alignment function was validated against skewed templates at angles of -2, +90, -90, and 180 degrees, all yielding satisfactory results without issues. \n\nAnalysis: \nThe successful handling of various transformations indicates that the alignment function's robustness has improved. This is significant as it suggests that the model can now accurately process a wider range of image orientations without degradation in performance.\n\nImpact: \nImproving the alignment function directly contributes to enhancing the overall accuracy of our recognition models, which is aligned with our project goal of increasing the system's reliability and versatility in recognizing diverse inputs.\n\nTASK 2: Model Accuracy Improvement for multi3_jpn\n-------------------\nProblem Description: \nThe recognition accuracy for the multi3_jpn model was suboptimal, particularly for long compound characters, which is crucial for correctly interpreting complex inputs.\n\nSolution Process: \nWe generated three new test cases and executed them using Python code. A detailed examination of the preprocessing steps was also conducted to identify areas for improvement.\n\nResults: \nInitial accuracy for long compound recognition was at 0/100. After preprocessing modifications, accuracy increased to 92/100. The overall recognition rate for numeric inputs improved from 1/100 to 99/100. \n\nAnalysis: \nThe preprocessing adjustments, particularly the transition from white to gray padding in images, had a direct impact on recognition performance. The previous white padding adversely affected the recognition of characters in less populated images, leading to lower accuracy rates.\n\nImpact: \nThis improvement in accuracy not only enhances the model's performance but also aligns with our strategic focus on delivering higher quality results to meet customer expectations, directly influencing user satisfaction and project success.\n\nTASK 3: Management of Temporary Files in User Profile\n-------------------\nProblem Description: \nTemporary files from the ONNX runtime were cluttering the USERPROFILE directory, potentially leading to performance issues and resource wastage.\n\nSolution Process: \nWe introduced a new utility class, FileSystemUtil.java, to facilitate the cleanup of temporary files generated during the multi-character recognition process.\n\nResults: \nThe implementation now allows for efficient management and deletion of temporary files, reducing unnecessary clutter.\n\nAnalysis: \nBy streamlining file management, we mitigate risks of performance degradation and enhance system resource utilization. This proactive approach is essential for maintaining system efficiency over time.\n\nImpact: \nEfficient resource management contributes to improved application performance, ultimately supporting our goal of creating a more responsive and user-friendly application environment.\n\nUPCOMING WORK:\n- Finalize and deploy the enhancements made to the recognition models.\n- Continue testing and refining the alignment function with additional templates.\n- Monitor system performance post-implementation of the FileSystemUtil class and adjust as necessary.\n\nCRITICAL REMINDERS:\n- Ensure all metric changes are double-checked for accuracy and confirmed before reporting.\n- For every performance metric, provide clear reasoning for its increase or decrease.\n- Consistently apply best practices in coding and testing to maintain high-quality outputs.",
